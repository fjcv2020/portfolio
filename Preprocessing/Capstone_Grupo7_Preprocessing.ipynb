La empresa cuenta con un autoservicio de BI con ReportServer por lo que podemos considerar que se encuentra en la fase 4. Reporting Avanzado / estratégico del Módelo de Madurez de Analytics, por lo que quedaría pendiente trabajar en la modelización predictiva de los productos a vender y la analítica prescriptiva de la empresa.\n","\n","Es por ello, que empezamos conociendo este Notebook, la información de la empresa proporcionada por el área de IT, la cual consta de 5 archivos .CSV que resumiremos a continuación y en el que pueden conocer más en el archivo adjunto Tablas - Descripción.xlsx.\n","\n","Se nos han entregado 5 archivos:\n","1. **customer_commercial_Activity**: con 5.962.924 records (filas), donde se otorga una primera vista a la base de clientes de Easy Money, la cual puede entenderse como la base de información de cada cliente durante los meses analizados (pk_partition)\n","\n","2. **customer_products**: con 5.962.924 records (filas), donde se observa los productos activos de cada cliente durante los meses analizados (pk_partition). En su mayoría son columnas booleanas (para los productos) y permite observar la evolución (altas y bajas) de los productos que cada cliente mantiene con Easy Money.\n","\n","3. **customer_sociodemographic**: con 5.962.924 records (filas), se observa la información personal de cada cliente durante los meses analizados (pk_partition). Esta información nos permite conocer más a los clientes y segmentar de la mejor manera.\n","\n","4. **sales**: con 240.772 records (filas), se observar las ventas realizadas durante 16 meses (month_Sale). Además, el producto y el margen neto cada venta.\n","\n","5. **product_description**: con 13 records (filas), se hace referencia a los productos y familia de productos de Easy money.\n","\n","Para el correcto preprocesamiento de las tablas, hemos realizado una primera vista buscando duplicados y nulos. Posteriormente, se ha trabajado cada columna para homogenizar las variables, trabajar los nulos y cambiar el tipo de variable.\n","\n","Posteriormente, hemos creado el modelo relacional de los datos. Donde en una primera instancia se ha realizado join de las tablas customer_commercial_Activity, customer_products y customer_sociodemographic, para trabajar la información de cada cliente en una misma tabla. Por otro lado, se ha realizado un join para las tablas de sales y product_description. De esta manera, conoceremos el productos y su familia para cada venta realizada.\n","\n","Realizado este procesamiento y teniendo una mejor visión de la información, hemos creado nuevas variables y nuevas tablas que nos ayudarán a profundizar en el entendimeinto del negocio.\n","\n","Al final del proyecto, tendremos un entendimiento más profundo de la información de los clientes y las ventas realizadas.\n","\n","Trabajo realizado por:\n","* **Francisco Camacho**\n","* **Mariela Drago**"],"metadata":{"id":"t6M1nCRBlNGs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hLXYRkfjoCW3"},"source":["### Montamos drive e importamos las librerías necesarias"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":19339,"status":"ok","timestamp":1688986611595,"user":{"displayName":"Mariela Drago","userId":"03251255887811582000"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"q3YMAskLhHBH","outputId":"96060e56-a64f-44d7-8a79-fac44507c2bf"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["# Montamos Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"VGlWARXWguOp"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Importamos las librerías necesarias\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import matplotlib.image as mpimg\n","import seaborn as sns\n","\n","plt.style.use(\"ggplot\")\n","\n","from google.colab import files\n","\n","from sklearn import model_selection\n","import xgboost as xgb\n","\n","from scipy import stats\n","from datetime import datetime\n","import random\n","\n","#import xgboost as xgb\n","#from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","#from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score\n","#from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n","#from sklearn.svm import SVC\n","#from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3guktlUrnyTn"},"source":["### Cargamos los datos facilitados"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bSgSSQ8igya1"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Cargar los datos\n","\n","DATA_PATH = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/MDS - Grupo 7/Capstone/datasets_TFM + diccionario\"\n","customer_commercial_activity = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH+ \"/customer_commercial_activity.csv\")\n","customer_products = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + \"/customer_products.csv\")\n","customer_sociodemographics = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + \"/customer_sociodemographics.csv\")\n","sales = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + \"/sales.csv\")\n","product_description = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + \"/product_description.csv\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"E6KqGLgbCikk"},"outputs":[],"source":["customer_commercial_activity.name = 'customer_commercial_activity'\n","customer_products.name = 'customer_products'\n","customer_sociodemographics.name = 'customer_sociodemographics'\n","sales.name = 'sales'\n","product_description.name = 'product_description'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6KTvmkitJ3cT"},"outputs":[],"source":["df_juntos = {'customer_commercial_activity': customer_commercial_activity, 'customer_products': customer_products, 'customer_sociodemographics': customer_sociodemographics, 'sales': sales, 'product_description':product_description}\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pdv0e_cxoH8q"},"source":["# **1.
